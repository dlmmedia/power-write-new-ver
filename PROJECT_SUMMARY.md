# PowerWrite - Project Summary

## Overview

PowerWrite is a modern, AI-powered book writing application built with Next.js 15, featuring an IMDB-inspired dark UI. The application allows users to search for reference books using the Google Books API and generate new books using OpenAI's GPT-4 via the Vercel AI SDK.

### ✅ Database Schema
- Users table with authentication support
- Generated books with full metadata
- Book chapters for individual chapter management
- Book searches history
- Reference books for user uploads (structure ready)
- Session management for authentication

### ✅ Google Books Integration
- Search books by query
- Browse bestsellers
- Browse new releases
- Filter by genre
- Get detailed book information
- Works without API key for basic searches (public API)

### ✅ AI-Powered Book Generation
- **Vercel AI SDK** integration with OpenAI GPT-4
- **AI Gateway** support for enhanced security and monitoring
- Generate complete book outlines with:
  - Title, author, genre
  - Multiple chapters with summaries
  - Characters and themes
  - Word count targets
- Generate individual chapters with:
  - Contextual awareness of previous chapters
  - Streaming support for real-time generation
  - Configurable length and style
- Reference book support (structure ready)

### ✅ IMDB-Inspired UI
- Dark theme with yellow accents (IMDB color scheme)
- Responsive grid layout for books
- Category tabs (Bestsellers, New Releases, etc.)
- Book cards with cover images and ratings
- Hero section with dynamic background
- Search functionality in header
- Professional navigation

### ✅ API Routes
- `/api/books/search` - Search and browse books
  - Query parameter: `q` for search
  - Category parameter: `category` (bestsellers, new-releases)
  - Genre parameter: `genre` for filtering
- `/api/generate/outline` - Generate book outlines
  - Accepts configuration for genre, tone, audience, etc.
  - Returns structured JSON outline
  - 5-minute timeout for complex generations

### ✅ Configuration & Deployment
- Complete `.env.example` with all required variables
- `vercel.json` configured for optimal deployment
- `drizzle.config.ts` for database migrations
- Database push scripts in package.json
- Comprehensive README and SETUP guides

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Ready:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API for generation
- `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` - Optional (works without)
- `AI_GATEWAY_URL` - Optional (recommended for production)

## Features Ready for Development

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Book Detail Pages** - Individual book pages with full information
2. **Book Studio** - Rich text editor for writing and editing
3. **User Authentication** - Sign up, login, user profiles
4. **PDF Export** - Export books to PDF format
5. **Reference Upload** - Allow users to upload PDF, DOCX, TXT files

### Future Enhancements:
- Audiobook generation with TTS
- Multi-book projects
- Collaboration features
- Payment integration
- Advanced AI customization
- Book templates
- Citation management

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Next.js application initialized
- [x] Database schema defined
- [x] API routes created
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Vercel configuration ready
- [x] README and guides written
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] Database pushed to production
- [ ] Domain configured (optional)
- [ ] AI Gateway configured (optional)

## Testing Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Add your API keys
4. Push database: `npm run db:push`
5. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
6. Open http://localhost:3000

## Performance Considerations

- **Serverless Functions**: 5-minute timeout for AI generation
- **Database**: Neon serverless with connection pooling
- **AI Gateway**: Rate limiting and caching (when configured)
- **Google Books**: No rate limits for public API
- **Next.js**: Automatic code splitting and optimization

## Security Features

- Environment variable validation
- Database connection over SSL
- AI Gateway for API security (optional)
- No hardcoded secrets
- Secure session management (structure ready)

## Known Limitations

1. TTS service is stubbed (not implemented)
2. User authentication not implemented
3. File upload functionality not implemented
4. PDF generation not implemented
5. Rich text editor not implemented

## Success Metrics

The application successfully:
- ✅ Fetches and displays books from Google Books API
- ✅ Generates book outlines using AI
- ✅ Generates individual chapters with context
- ✅ Provides IMDB-inspired user interface
- ✅ Supports Vercel AI Gateway
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Conclusion

PowerWrite is a fully functional foundation for an AI-powered book writing application. The core infrastructure, database schema, AI integration, and UI are complete and ready for deployment. The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features and scale the application.

The application can be deployed to Vercel immediately and will work with minimal configuration (just DATABASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY required).
