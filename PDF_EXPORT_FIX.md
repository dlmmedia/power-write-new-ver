# PDF Export Fix

## Issues Fixed

The PDF export functionality has been improved with the following fixes:

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added explicit error handlers for PDFKit's error events
- Added console logging for debugging PDF generation issues
- Added try-catch wrapper in the export API route for better error reporting

### 2. **Improved PDFKit Configuration**
- Set `bufferPages: true` to enable page buffering
- Set `autoFirstPage: false` for manual page control (book export)
- Explicitly call `doc.addPage()` for the title page to ensure consistent page creation

### 3. **Better Content Rendering**
- Fixed paragraph splitting using regex `/\n\n+/` to handle multiple newlines
- Added `cleanPara` to remove single newlines within paragraphs
- Added proper text width constraints for centered title text
- Improved line spacing with `lineGap` parameter

### 4. **Fixed Page Management**
- Each chapter now gets its own page (removed conditional logic)
- Title page is always created first
- More consistent page breaks between chapters

### 5. **Better Logging**
- Added detailed console logs for PDF generation process
- Logs include book title, chapter count, and final file size
- Error logs show specific error messages

## Files Modified

1. **lib/services/export-service-advanced.ts**
   - `exportBookAsPDF()` method improved
   - `exportOutlineAsPDF()` method improved
   - Removed unused `index` variable

2. **app/api/books/export/route.ts**
   - Added try-catch wrapper around export generation
   - Added detailed logging for PDF and DOCX exports
   - Better error responses with specific error messages

## Testing

To test the PDF export:

1. Ensure the dev server is running: `npm run dev --webpack`
2. Navigate to a book in the library
3. Click "Export â–¼" and select "Export as PDF"
4. Check browser console for any error messages
5. Verify the downloaded PDF opens correctly and contains all chapters

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'pdfkit'"
**Solution**: The package is already installed. Run `npm install` if needed.

### Issue: PDF is blank or corrupted
**Solution**: Check the console logs for errors. Verify that chapters have content.

### Issue: Font errors
**Solution**: PDFKit uses built-in Helvetica fonts which don't require external files.

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements for future versions:

1. Add custom fonts support for more typography options
2. Add page numbers and headers/footers
3. Support for formatting (bold, italic, etc.) in chapter content
4. Add table of contents generation
5. Support for cover images
6. Add configurable page margins and font sizes
