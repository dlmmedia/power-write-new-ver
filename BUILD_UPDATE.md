## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management Flow
```
User Action → updateConfig() → Zustand Store → LocalStorage
                                    ↓
                            Component Re-render
                                    ↓
                            UI Updates (instant)
```

### Studio Architecture
```
app/studio/page.tsx (Main)
    ├── Header (sticky)
    │   ├── Back button
    │   ├── Reference count badge
    │   ├── Generate Outline button
    │   └── Generate Book button
    │
    ├── Sidebar (col-span-3)
    │   ├── Tab navigation (11 tabs)
    │   └── Reference books list
    │
    └── Main Panel (col-span-9)
        └── Dynamic config component based on activeTab
```

### Config Components Pattern
```typescript
// Each config component follows this pattern:
export const ConfigName: React.FC = () => {
  const { config, updateConfig } = useStudioStore();
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Header */}
      {/* Form fields */}
      {/* Summary panel */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Studio Config**: 12 sections need implementation (placeholders currently shown)
2. **Outline Display**: Need to show generated outline and allow editing
3. **Generate Book**: Button exists but not yet functional
4. **Reference Analysis**: File upload and AI analysis not yet implemented
5. **Auto-population**: Reference book data should auto-fill fields (stub exists in store)

---

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Button Groups Instead of Dropdowns?
- **Better UX**: See all options at once
- **Faster Selection**: Single click vs click-scroll-click
- **Visual Feedback**: Active state is immediately visible
- **Mobile Friendly**: Easier to tap on mobile devices

### Why Separate Components per Config Section?
- **Modularity**: Easy to maintain and extend
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Lazy Loading**: Can load sections on-demand later
- **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently

### Why LocalStorage for Demo Account?
- **No Auth Needed**: Simple for MVP/demo
- **Instant Setup**: Works immediately
- **Privacy**: No server-side data storage
- **Easy Migration**: Can migrate to real auth later
