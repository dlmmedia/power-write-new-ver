3. **Caching**:
   - ✅ Browse books, refresh page, verify faster load times
   - ✅ Search same query multiple times, check speed improvement

4. **Studio - Fiction**:
   - ✅ Select fiction book as reference
   - ✅ Auto-populate should work
   - ✅ Characters section should be visible
   - ✅ Generate outline and verify character inclusion

5. **Studio - Non-Fiction**:
   - ✅ Select non-fiction book as reference (e.g., biography, history, self-help)
   - ✅ Auto-populate should work
