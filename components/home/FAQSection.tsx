    question: 'How does AI book generation work?',
    answer: 'PowerWrite uses advanced large language models trained on millions of books. You provide the configuration (genre, style, characters, plot), and the AI generates professional-quality content that follows narrative conventions and maintains consistency throughout your book.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I edit the generated content?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! Think of AI as your co-writer. Generate content, then edit, refine, and personalize it. You can also regenerate specific chapters with different parameters if needed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns the copyright to AI-generated books?',
    answer: 'You do! All content generated through PowerWrite belongs to you. You can publish, sell, or distribute your books however you like, including on Amazon KDP, other platforms, or traditional publishing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What genres can I write?',
    answer: 'All major genres: Fiction (literary, commercial), Romance, Mystery/Thriller, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, Historical Fiction, Young Adult, Children\'s Books, Non-Fiction, Business, Self-Help, and more.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to generate a book?',
    answer: 'A typical 80,000-word novel takes 5-15 minutes to generate, depending on server load and your quality settings. Longer books or higher quality modes may take longer.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the content plagiarism-free?',
    answer: 'Yes! The AI generates original content based on patterns learned from training data, not by copying existing works. Each book is unique.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this for commercial purposes?',
    answer: 'Yes, with Pro and Enterprise plans. You can publish and sell books generated with PowerWrite on any platform, including Amazon, Kobo, Apple Books, etc.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What formats can I export to?',
    answer: 'Free plan: PDF. Pro and Enterprise: PDF, DOCX (Microsoft Word), and EPUB (e-book format). All formats are properly formatted and ready for publishing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer refunds?',
    answer: 'Yes! If you\'re not satisfied within the first 30 days, we offer a full refund, no questions asked. We want you to love PowerWrite.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I collaborate with other writers?',
    answer: 'Enterprise plans support team collaboration with multiple users, shared projects, version control, and commenting features.'
