- Cost: ~$2-3 per 30,000-word book

### ✅ Book Covers
- DALL-E 3 professional covers
- Portrait orientation (1024x1792)
- Genre-appropriate styling
- HD quality
- Cost: ~$0.08 per cover

### ✅ Database Operations
- Save generated books
- Store chapters
- Track user data
- Reference book management

## Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Outline Generation (CLI)
```bash
node test-outline.mjs
```

Expected output:
```
✓ SUCCESS!
Generated Outline:
- Title: [AI-generated title]
- Author: Test Author
- Genre: Mystery
- Chapters: 10
```

### Test 2: Outline Generation (UI)

2. Fill in:
   - Title: "My Test Book"
   - Author: Your name
   - Genre: Choose any
   - Description: Brief plot summary
3. Click "Generate Outline"
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. See generated outline with chapters

### Test 3: Full Book Generation (UI)
1. After generating outline
2. Click "Generate Full Book"
3. Wait 5-10 minutes (watch progress)
4. Book saves to Library automatically

## Cost Breakdown

### Per Book (10 chapters, 30,000 words)
- Outline: $0.01 (GPT-4o-mini)
- Chapters: $2.50 (GPT-4o, 10 chapters × 3k words)
- Cover: $0.08 (DALL-E 3)
- **Total: ~$2.59 per complete book**

### Development/Testing
- Test outlines: ~$0.01 each (very cheap)
- Short test chapters: ~$0.10 each
- Budget for testing: $5-10 should generate multiple complete books

## Configuration Files Changed

1. **`.env.local`**
   - Added: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Removed: AI Gateway keys, Anthropic key
   
2. **`lib/services/ai-service.ts`**
   - Removed: Anthropic dependency
   - Changed: All models use OpenAI
   - Updated: DALL-E 3 for covers (was Google Imagen)
   - Changed: GPT-4o for chapters (was Claude Sonnet 4)

3. **`lib/db/index.ts`**
   - Fixed: WebSocket configuration for Neon
   - Added: Pipeline connection disable for dev

4. **`package.json`**
   - Added: `dotenv-cli` for database commands
   - Updated: `db:push` and `db:studio` scripts

5. **Dependencies Added**
   - `bufferutil` - WebSocket performance
   - `utf-8-validate` - WebSocket validation
   - `dotenv-cli` - Environment loading for scripts
   - `dotenv` - Environment loading for test scripts

## Model Comparison: Why GPT-4o?

### GPT-4o for Chapters
- ✅ Excellent creative writing
- ✅ Strong character development
- ✅ Good narrative consistency
- ✅ Faster than GPT-4 Turbo
- ✅ More cost-effective
- ✅ 128K context window

### GPT-4o-mini for Outlines
- ✅ Perfect for structured output
- ✅ 60% cheaper than GPT-4o
- ✅ 2x faster
- ✅ Reliable JSON formatting
- ✅ Good enough for planning

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Starting
```bash
# Kill any existing process
pkill -f "next dev"

# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run dev --webpack
```

### API Key Errors
Check `.env.local` has:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connection
npm run db:push

# Should show: "[i] No changes detected"
```

### Generation Takes Too Long
- Outlines: Should be 5-10 seconds
- Chapters: 30-60 seconds each
- Full book: 5-10 minutes total
- If longer: Check your internet connection and OpenAI API status

## Next Steps

### 1. Start Building Books! 🎯
```bash
# Server is already running on port 3001
# Go to: http://localhost:3001/studio
```

### 2. Explore Features
- **Studio**: Create and configure books
- **Library**: View generated books
- **Search**: Find reference books (Google Books API)

### 3. Customize Generation
In Studio, you can control:
- Number of chapters
- Target word count
- Writing style
- Point of view
- Tone and pacing
- Genre-specific settings

### 4. Export Options (Future)
- PDF export (scaffolded)
- EPUB export (scaffolded)
- Audiobook generation (TTS service ready)

## Performance Tips

### Faster Generation
- Use fewer chapters for testing (5 instead of 10)
- Lower word count for drafts (50k instead of 80k)
- Test with GPT-4o-mini for chapters (faster, cheaper)

### Better Quality
- More detailed descriptions
- Add reference books for inspiration
- Use custom instructions
- Iterate on outlines before full generation

### Cost Optimization
- Test outlines first (very cheap)
- Generate one chapter at a time initially
- Use GPT-4o-mini for drafts, GPT-4o for final

## Database Schema

Your database has these tables:
- `users` - Demo user account
- `generatedBooks` - Saved books
- `bookChapters` - Individual chapters
- `bookSearches` - Search history
- `referenceBooks` - Uploaded references
- `sessions` - User sessions

## System Architecture

## Files You Can Delete (Optional Cleanup)

These are old documentation files that are no longer relevant:
- `AI_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` (old AI Gateway docs)
- `AI_GATEWAY_UNIFIED.md` (superseded)
- `FIX_OUTLINE_GENERATION.md` (issue fixed)
- `test-outline.mjs` (testing script, can keep for debugging)

## Summary

**Everything is working!** You can now:

1. ✅ Generate book outlines
2. ✅ Generate full books with multiple chapters
3. ✅ Create book covers with DALL-E 3
4. ✅ Save books to database
5. ✅ View books in library
6. ✅ Search for reference books

The system is using your OpenAI API key for all operations, and costs are reasonable (~$2.59 per complete book with cover).
